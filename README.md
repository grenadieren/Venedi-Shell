## FAQ

#### When will it be released?
I really don't know. Most likely after version 0.10

#### Why make it if we have the Windows/Linux terminal?
First of all. It's my personal project. Second. I want to make a terminal with lots of useful features, which will be far more easy to use than in the WIndows Terminal, or with Bash

#### When will it stop being maintained?
Probably never.
